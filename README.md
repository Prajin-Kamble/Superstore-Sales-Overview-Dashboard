# Superstore-Sales-Overview-Dashboard

## 1. Business problem statements
A retail superstore generates thousands of sales transactions across multiple product categories, customer segments, regions, and time periods. However, the business lacks a centralized analytical view to effectively monitor sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, and regional trends.<br>
The management team needs an interactive and easy-to-understand dashboard to analyze historical sales data, identify top 10 performing products and regions, discounts on profitability, and understand seasonal sales patterns. Without these insights, decision-making related to pricing strategy, inventory planning, regional sales focus, and customer targeting becomes inefficient.<br>
The objective of this project is to analyze the Superstore e-commerce sales dataset and build a Power BI dashboard that provides key performance indicators (KPIs), product-wise and region-wise sales analysis, customer segment insights, and time-based trends to support data-driven business decisions across sales, marketing, finance, and operations teams.
